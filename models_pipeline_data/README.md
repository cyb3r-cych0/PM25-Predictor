# Models Pipeline Data

This directory contains the outputs from training and evaluating various machine learning models for PM₂.₅ concentration prediction. Each model's results are stored in separate files, including trained models, predictions, metrics, and visualizations.

## 📘 Purpose

The files in this folder represent the **model artifacts and evaluation results** generated during the training and testing phases of the project. They are used for:

- Storing serialized models for future predictions or deployment.
- Analyzing model performance through metrics and predictions.
- Generating trend analyses and comparative figures.
- Ensuring reproducibility of results.

## 🗂️ Contents

The directory includes outputs for the following models:
- **GradientBoosting**: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Lasso**: Lasso Regression
- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network
- **MLR**: Multiple Linear Regression (likely Ridge or similar, based on naming)
- **RandomForest**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Ridge**: Ridge Regression

For each model, the following files are typically present:

| File Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `{Model}_model.joblib` | Serialized trained model (e.g., `GradientBoosting_model.joblib`) | Used for loading and making predictions |
| `{Model}_FULL_predictions_2000_2025.csv` | Full predictions over the entire period (2000–2025) | CSV with predicted PM₂.₅ values |
| `{Model}_TEST_predictions.csv` | Predictions on the test set | CSV for evaluation |
| `{Model}_metrics.json` | Performance metrics (e.g., R², RMSE, MAE) | JSON file with evaluation scores |
| `{Model}_FULL.png` | Visualization of full predictions vs. actual | PNG plot |
| `{Model}_trend_summary_FULL.csv` | Summary of trends (actual vs. predicted) | CSV with trend slopes and statistics |
| `{Model}_TEST.png` (for LSTM) | Test set visualization | PNG plot specific to LSTM |

Additional files:
- `lstm_best.h5`: Best LSTM model weights (HDF5 format)
- `lstm_scaler_X.joblib`, `lstm_scaler_y.joblib`: Scalers for LSTM input/output normalization

## 📊 Usage

- **Loading Models**: Use `joblib.load('{Model}_model.joblib')` to reload a trained model for inference.
- **Evaluating Performance**: Review `{Model}_metrics.json` for key metrics like R², RMSE, and MAE.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze `{Model}_trend_summary_FULL.csv` for long-term bias and trend information.
- **Visualizations**: Open PNG files to inspect prediction plots and diagnostics.

## 🧠 Integration with Pipeline

These files are generated by scripts in `../models_pipeline.py` or similar training scripts. They feed into trend analysis scripts (e.g., in `plot_scripts/`) and comparative reporting.

Ensure models are retrained if datasets change, as these artifacts depend on the aligned data in `meteo_data/`.
